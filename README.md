An interactive HR analytics dashboard built in Power BI to analyze employee attrition, salary trends, and workforce demographics. This project leverages SQL, DAX, and data visualization techniques to provide actionable insights for HR decision-making and retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
Power BI – Data visualization and dashboarding
SQL (Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL) – Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and aggregations
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data preprocessing and trend analysis

## Key Features
Attrition Analysis – Breakdown by age, job role, salary, and experience
Salary & Workforce Trends – Identify compensation gaps and risk areas
Dynamic Insights – Drill-through reports and interactive filters
Optimized Performance – Pre-aggregated data models for faster analytics

## Methodology & Approach
## Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Used Python (Pandas) & SQL for data cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing attributes
Optimized data for faster Power BI performance through DAX measures and calculated columns

## Data Modeling & ETL Pipeline:
Designed a relational data model for efficient analysis
Applied SQL queries for pre-aggregations to improve dashboard responsiveness

## Advanced DAX Calculations:
Implemented dynamic measures for real-time filtering
Created conditional formatting for high-impact insights

## Interactive Visualizations & Storytelling:
Drill-through reports for granular analysis
Custom slicers & filters to enable real-time exploration

## Impact & Business Value
Enables HR teams to identify and predict high-risk employee groups
Data-driven strategies to improve employee retention & workforce planning
Optimized reporting speed with pre-aggregated data models
Actionable insights into compensation structures & attrition trends

## How to Use
