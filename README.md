An interactive HR analytics dashboard built in Power BI to analyze employee attrition, salary trends, and workforce demographics. This project leverages SQL, DAX, and data visualization techniques to provide actionable insights for HR decision-making and retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
Power BI – Data visualization and dashboarding
SQL (Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL) – Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and aggregations
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) – Data preprocessing and trend analysis

## Key Features
## Workforce Overview
1) Displays the total number of employees (1,470) and attrition statistics (237 employees, 16.1% attrition rate)
Salary & Experience Analysis – Avg. salary of $6.5K, avg. experience 7 years
2) Attrition Analysis
By Age Group – Highest attrition in the 26-35 age range (606 employees)
By Education Field – Life Sciences & Medical backgrounds have the highest attrition rates
By Salary Slab – Employees earning ≤ $5K have the highest attrition (749 employees), indicating compensation may be a key driver
3) Job Role Insights
Sales Executives, Research Scientists, and Lab Technicians experience the highest turnover
Attrition by Years at Company – Peak attrition occurs within the first 5 years, suggesting a need for early engagement strategies

## Methodology & Approach
## Data Cleaning & Transformation:
Used Python (Pandas) & SQL for data cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing attributes
Optimized data for faster Power BI performance through DAX measures and calculated columns

## Data Modeling & ETL Pipeline:
Designed a relational data model for efficient analysis
Applied SQL queries for pre-aggregations to improve dashboard responsiveness

## Advanced DAX Calculations:
Implemented dynamic measures for real-time filtering
Created conditional formatting for high-impact insights

## Interactive Visualizations & Storytelling:
Drill-through reports for granular analysis
Custom slicers & filters to enable real-time exploration

## Impact & Business Value
